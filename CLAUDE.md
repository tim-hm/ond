# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository. Global workflow and core principles are in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

## 1. Guiding Principles

1. **Types**: Code must be strongly typed. Avoid `any`, `as`, force-unwraps, and other type-safety escape hatches. Inferred types are acceptable within function bodies; function signatures and complex types are explicit.
2. **Documentation**: The doc comment carries the explanation; inline comments must earn their line.
   - **Explain on the item.** A `///` / `//!` block (Rust) or `///` block (Swift) documents every public function (and its parameters), every enum (and its values), and every non-obvious exported type. Put the _why_ there: the constraint, the invariant, the ordering hazard, the external quirk, the regression the code guards against.
   - **Three inline comments earn their line**: (a) a step marker segmenting a genuinely long body, sitting directly on the code it describes; (b) a fact the reader cannot deduce from the code, anchored to one specific statement — `// Postgres 18 moved the data directory` on the exact volume mount; (c) a note that the code is deliberately unusual or suboptimal-looking, so the next reader doesn't "fix" it. A body needing a signpost every few lines wants a named function instead.
   - **Delete restatements.** If the code says it as well or better, the comment goes: no `// Sort by sort_order` above an `ORDER BY sort_order`.
   - **Never comment on distant code.** A comment is only trustworthy inside the edit radius of the code it describes. Section banners (`// ── Types ──`, `// ==== Helpers ====`) assert a file layout that nothing enforces — an editor working 200 lines below never has them in context, so they rot silently. Banned.
   - **Always keep, verbatim**: `SAFETY:`, `TODO`/`FIXME`, and tool pragmas (`#[allow(...)]` justifications, `swiftlint:disable`). Deleting one breaks the build or silences a real warning.
   - **Never commit** commented-out code, or comments narrating the edit you just made ("Added in…", "Changed from…"). Git already holds that history.
   - Use an active voice. Use camel case for abbreviations in identifiers and type names: `Did`, not `DID`; `TechniqueId`, not `TechniqueID`. Prose keeps the natural form — "the technique's ID".
   - Assume the reader has a working knowledge of the codebase.
3. **Ergonomics and DX**: Prioritise intuitive API design and developer experience.
4. **Minimal Environment Footprint**: Environment variables are for secrets and essential boot-time context only. The backend reads exactly two — `OND_ENV` and `DATABASE_URL`. Everything else is derived in `crates/api/src/config.rs` — including which provider, region, and model the assistant calls, because a model id that could differ between a laptop and a deployment is exactly the drift this rule exists to prevent. There is no provider key: the assistant signs its Bedrock calls with the EC2 instance profile, which the AWS SDK finds through its default credential chain without being told, and where that chain resolves to nothing the assistant answers from its rule-based fallback. Every new variable is a value that can differ between the two without anything noticing.
5. **Derivation by Convention**: Ports, log format, and CORS policy derive from `OND_ENV`. Prefer deriving over configuring.
6. **Code Structure**: Follow [docs/code-structure.md](docs/code-structure.md) — feature-first (not layer-first), three-tier escalation, and the naming conventions defined there.

## 2. Architecture

A Cargo workspace (`crates/`) and two native SwiftUI apps (`ios/`) sharing one Protobuf contract (`proto/`). PostgreSQL is the only datastore. Both clients talk **gRPC-Web** to a tonic backend; a small JSON surface (`/health`, `/about`) exists for `curl`.

```text
proto/          the contract — single source of truth for both languages
crates/api      axum (JSON) + tonic (gRPC-Web) on one port
crates/migrate  schema migrations + the seeded technique catalogue
ios/            two app targets — Ond (iOS) and OndWatch (watchOS) —
                over one local SwiftPM package, OndCore; OndKit bundles
                catalogue.json, the seed exported from crates/migrate that
                both apps breathe before they have ever reached the server
web/            the marketing one-pager; static at serve time, but its
                technique figures are generated from the app's own geometry
infra/          OpenTofu for the one box the whole thing deploys onto
```

All önd ports live in **18100–18199** (API 18100, Postgres 18101, `web/` preview 18102). See [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md) for why the block starts there.

### Where code lives

- **Router assembly** — `crates/api/src/lib.rs`. `main.rs` is process startup only; everything else is library so `tests/e2e/` drives the same stack a deployment serves.
- **AppState** — `crates/api/src/state.rs`, shared as `Arc<AppState>`.
- **Features** — `crates/api/src/features/<name>/` with `handlers/`, `service.rs`, `repository.rs`, `types.rs`, `errors.rs`.
- **gRPC registration** — `crates/api/src/grpc.rs`. **HTTP routes** — `crates/api/src/http/mod.rs`. Both are single aggregation points.
- **Generated protobuf** — Rust into `OUT_DIR` via `crates/api/build.rs`, re-exported through `crates/api/src/proto.rs`; Swift committed under `ios/Packages/OndCore/Sources/OndAPI/Generated/`.
- **Domain models (Swift)** — the `OndKit` target in `ios/Packages/OndCore/`. Only it touches generated protobuf types; `OndAPI` is not a package product, so neither app target can import one.
- **App targets (Swift)** — `ios/Ond/` (iOS) and `ios/OndWatch/` (watchOS), each with its own composition root over the same three products. What they share and what they deliberately duplicate is in [docs/code-structure.md](docs/code-structure.md).

## 3. Development

**Mise-first rule**: run every repo operation through `mise run <task>` — never raw `cargo clippy/test/sqlx`, `buf generate`, `xcodebuild`, or `swiftlint`. The tasks encode the env (`SQLX_OFFLINE`, `DATABASE_URL`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`) those commands need to behave identically here, in a fresh clone, and in CI. `mise tasks` lists everything; if an operation has no task, add one rather than bypassing.

This rule has teeth: a shell that has visited the sibling `connect` repo exports a `DATABASE_URL` pointing at _its_ database on port 15432. Running `cargo run -p migrate` directly from such a shell targets the wrong cluster. `mise run migrate` cannot.

**Toolkit-first rule**: helper tooling is a mise task or a subcommand of a future `toolkit` crate — never a loose bash/python script. `scripts/` does not exist and should stay that way.

| Intent                                     | Task                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Full validation (the gate)                 | `mise run check`                                      |
| Auto-fix formatting + lint                 | `mise run fix`                                        |
| Regenerate every derived artefact          | `mise run generate`                                   |
| Start Postgres                             | `mise run dev:db`                                     |
| Apply migrations + seed                    | `mise run migrate`                                    |
| Run the API with reload                    | `mise run dev`                                        |
| Query the database                         | `echo 'select …;' \| mise run db:psql`                |
| Rebuild the DB from scratch                | `mise run dev:db:reset`                               |
| Generate + open the Xcode project          | `mise run ios:gen` / `mise run ios:open`              |
| Build, run on a simulator, run on hardware | `mise run ios:{build,sim,device}:{phone,watch}`       |
| Tests                                      | `mise run test` (`test:rs`, `test:e2e`, `test:swift`) |
| Live backend + iPhone UI system tests      | `mise run test:system`                                |
| Informational Rust + Swift coverage        | `mise run coverage`                                   |

**Before committing** — three commands, in this order:

```bash
mise run generate   # 1. Protobuf, catalogue export, site figures, SQLx cache
mise run fmt        # 2. Format
mise run check      # 3. Full validation
```

`mise run check` runs `check:swift` and `test:swift` through `check:mac`, which detects the Swift toolchain and skips loudly where there is none — so a headless environment still passes the gate without pretending it validated the Swift.

`check:diagrams` stays outside the gate even so, because it builds `OndDiagrams` to redraw the marketing site's figures from the app's own geometry — minutes rather than seconds, and it only has an opinion when `ios/` or `web/` changed. Run it whenever you touch either; without it the page keeps drawing a technique the app has since changed. Nothing else will catch that at the moment: GitHub Actions has been disabled since 2026-08-07, so `mise run check` on your own machine is the whole of the evidence. See [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md) for what re-enabling it needs.

### Commit messages

`<prefix>: <description>`, where the prefix names the area, the feature, or the kind of change, and the description says what changed in the imperative.

The prefix is a hint for someone scanning `git log`, not a taxonomy. `technique:`, `ios:`, `proto:`, `migrate:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `deps:` are all fine, and so is a conventional-commit type like `fix:` or `refactor:` when the _kind_ of change is more useful than the area. No `(scope)` brackets, no fixed vocabulary, nothing enforcing it — this is a convention because a log that reads consistently is faster to scan, not because a tool parses it.

Keep the subject under ~72 characters. The body is for _why_: the constraint that forced the approach, the alternative rejected, the regression it guards. Git already records what changed; it cannot reconstruct the reasoning.

### Testing

Philosophy and patterns in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

- **Rust unit** — inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of the file under test. Runner is cargo-nextest via `mise run test:rs`, which is scoped to lib and bin targets so it needs no database.
- **Rust integration** — `crates/api/tests/e2e/`, via `mise run test:e2e`. Drives the production router over a disposable `ond_test_<name>_<run stamp>` database, one per test and isolated per run, using real gRPC-Web framing. Never point these at the dev database; the harness makes that structurally impossible and it should stay that way.
- **Swift** — Swift Testing, in `ios/Packages/OndCore/Tests/`. Runs on the host (the package declares a macOS platform for exactly this reason), so no simulator is needed.
