/// A copy of `api::obs::init` rather than a call to it, because the dependency
/// runs the other way: `api` dev-depends on this crate so its test harness
/// brings a disposable database up exactly as `mise run migrate` does, and a
/// migration runner that linked the whole API to share eight lines would be the
/// wrong direction whether or not Cargo permitted it. A third crate for eight
/// lines is structure nobody reads.
///
/// What the copy can drift on is the *set* of environment names, not the
/// variable: `api` derives its format from `Environment`, and this compares one
/// literal. A third environment therefore has to be taught here too.
