//! What a hostile caller gets, driven at the volume that makes the answer mean
//! something.
//!
//! The rest of this suite asks whether a feature is correct for one caller. This
//! file asks the opposite question — what happens when somebody does the thing
//! nobody should — and the only way to answer it is to actually do it, several
//! hundred times, through the real router over a real database. So these are
//! slower than their neighbours on purpose: a budget asserted at three requests
//! would pass against a limiter that had been switched off for everything above
//! ten.
//!
//! Every test here builds its router with the limiter's clock stopped, and none
//! of them may stop doing so. The budgets are fixed windows a minute wide, so a
//! burst that takes seconds is a burst that sometimes straddles a boundary and
//! is served twice — which made the assertion below fail about one run in
//! seven, on a control whose whole job is to hold at a number.
//! `TestDatabase::app_with_stopped_throttle` has the reasoning; what matters
//! here is that the wall clock is not a thing these tests are allowed to
//! measure, because they are the ones spending the budget.
