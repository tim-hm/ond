/// at 4 MiB. The service-level bounds (`journey`'s 200 sessions per batch, the
/// 8 KiB ceiling on a submitted App Store token) cannot help: they run against
/// a message that has already been read.
///
/// 256 KiB sits roughly six times above the biggest legitimate request, a full

/// entitlement surface — to anyone who asks. Wanting it against the deployed box
/// is the argument for the separate port `docs/observability.md` reserves for
/// metrics, not for registering it here. `infra/box/Caddyfile` declines to proxy
/// the path as well, because an unset `OND_ENV` falls back to `Dev` and this
/// gate therefore fails open.
///
/// There is deliberately no `tonic-health` service. Liveness is answered by the
/// JSON `/health` route, which is what an orchestrator or a human with `curl`
/// will actually probe; a second health surface that nothing queries is a
/// dependency and a status reporter to keep correct for no reader.
