//! Entitlement — one auto-renewable subscription, sold monthly and yearly in a
//! single App Store group, verified once and stored against the anonymous
//! identity `crate::identity` resolves.
//!
//! The division of labour with the client is the whole design. `StoreKit` answers
//! `Transaction.currentEntitlements` on the device, offline, so every piece of
//! UI gating reads from there and no screen ever waits on this server. What
//! lands here is the same purchase re-asserted as something the server can
//! check for itself, because two decisions must not be the client's: whether a
//! caller may spend a language-model call, and whether they may read a
//! leaderboard this server folds. `assistant` and `journey` read
//! [`service::tier`] and never a field off a request — one call, resolved from
//! the caller's own row, with the pairing of tier and expiry left where it
//! belongs.
//!
//! `verifier/` is the seam, in the shape `assistant::model` established — a
//! trait, a real implementation, and a scripted one for the tests.
