//! Checking an App Store signed transaction against Apple's root, in-process.
//!
//! ## Why this is written out rather than pulled in
//!
//! Apple ships an `app-store-server-library` for Java, Node, Swift, and Python,
//! and not for Rust. There is one well-maintained community port
//! (`app-store-server-library`, ~200k downloads a quarter), and it was the
//! obvious candidate. Three things decided against it:
//!
//! - **48 new crates against 16.** It carries typed structs for the whole App
//!   Store Server API — notifications, renewal info, the Advanced Commerce
//!   schema — and the crypto to match, including RSA and Ed25519 stacks this
//!   binary has no other use for. What is used here is one P-256 signature type.
//!   The route below adds no cryptographic implementation at all: `ring` is
//!   already linked through rustls, and everything new is DER parsing.
//! - **It does not check certificate validity dates**, and its chain walk
//!   carries a `TODO: Implement issuer checking`. Both are defensible choices
//!   made for reasons this app does not share, and neither is a choice that
//!   should be inherited silently in the one place where a signature check
//!   decides who gets to spend money.
//! - **The surface actually needed is one function.** Verifying a client's
//!   `Transaction.jwsRepresentation` is the only thing this server does with the
//!   App Store; there is no Server API client, no notification endpoint, and
//!   deliberately no plan for one at V1.
//!
//! The trade is that Apple's payload schema is transcribed here rather than
//! tracked upstream. Bounded, because only six fields are read, and additive
//! JSON is what `serde` ignores by default.
//!
//! ## What the check is
//!
//! Apple's own libraries define it, and this follows them step for step:
//! exactly three certificates in `x5c`, leaf first; `alg` must be `ES256`; the
//! leaf and the intermediate must each carry Apple's marker extension; every
//! certificate must have been valid when the transaction was signed; and the
//! chain must lead to Apple Root CA - G3.
//!
//! Everything after `alg` is `super::chain`'s, which knows nothing about
//! subscriptions. What is left here is the App Store's own format — the
//! segments, the payload schema, and the price list. The bundle id it is
//! checked against is `config::BUNDLE_ID`, shared with the Sign in with Apple
//! verifier so the two cannot come to mean different apps.
//!
//! ## What this cannot see
//!
//! A `jwsRepresentation` is a signed claim about a moment, not a live read of a
//! subscription. A refund issued after the client last synced is invisible here
//! until `StoreKit` hands the client the revoked transaction. That is what
//! deferring App Store Server Notifications costs, and it is affordable because
//! the worst case is honouring a refunded year — not because the gap isn't
//! real.
//!
//! ## What this rejects that you might not expect
//!
//! Transactions minted by Xcode's local `StoreKit` configuration file
//! (`ios/Ond/Ond.storekit`) are signed by a per-machine test certificate, not by
//! Apple. Simulator purchases therefore verify locally, entitle the UI locally,
//! and are refused here — which is the offline-first design working rather than
//! failing, since nothing on screen waits on this call. Exercising the server
//! half needs a sandbox tester on a real device; exercising what the server
//! *does* with an entitlement needs only
//! `UPDATE users SET subscription_tier = …, subscription_until = …`.
