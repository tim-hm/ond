//! The two boundaries every journey surface crosses.
//!
//! One is arithmetic: every number this feature serves is an aggregate over
//! `sessions` or `bolt_scores`, read back signed and sent unsigned. The other is
//! time: sessions carry instants, and the caller's UTC offset decides which
//! local day each one falls in.
//!
//! Both conversions are fallible, and deliberately so. These are the caller's
//! own figures and their own dates — a clamped count or a guessed instant is a
//! number somebody reads as theirs.
