//! The real [`ModelClient`]: Anthropic's Messages API, served by Amazon Bedrock.
//!
//! The only file in this feature that knows a provider exists. Everything above
//! it — quota, breaker, validation, fallback — is written against the trait in
//! `super::model`, so changing provider is this file and two constants in
//! `config.rs`.
//!
//! Bedrock is called directly rather than through an intermediary, which is the
//! whole point of the arrangement: no third party sees a person's words in
//! transit, and `web/privacy.html` can name exactly one processor. The call is
//! signed with the EC2 instance profile that `infra/main.tf` already attaches,
//! found through the AWS SDK's default credential chain — so there is no key on
//! the box and no environment variable naming one.
//!
//! Two things about the request body are Bedrock's rather than Anthropic's: the
//! model is named in the URL instead of the body, and `anthropic_version`
//! replaces it there. Everything else is the Messages API as documented,
//! `cache_control` included — it marks the end of the prefix Bedrock caches,
//! and it is why `ModelRequest` splits the prompt in two rather than handing
//! over one string.
