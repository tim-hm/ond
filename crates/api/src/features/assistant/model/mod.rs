//! The seam every language model sits behind.
//!
//! One trait, three implementations: `super::bedrock` calls a provider,
//! [`DisabledModelClient`] calls nothing, and the integration tests script one.
//! Everything else in this feature — quota, circuit breaker, validation,
//! fallback — is written against the trait, so all of it is exercised without a
//! network call and the only untested code is the thin layer that builds a
//! request body.
//!
//! The vocabulary is deliberately not a provider's. A `ModelRequest` is a
//! cacheable prefix, an instruction, and a ceiling; how that becomes a Messages
//! API call is `bedrock`'s business.
