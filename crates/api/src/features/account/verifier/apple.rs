//! Checking a Sign in with Apple identity token against Apple's published keys.
//!
//! ## What the check is
//!
//! An identity token is an ordinary JWT: three base64url segments, signed
//! RS256, whose header names the key by id rather than carrying it. So unlike
//! `entitlement::verifier::appstore` — which is handed the whole certificate
//! chain and can decide entirely in-process — the key has to be fetched from
//! Apple and kept. That fetch is the only reason this module has state.
//!
//! Five things must hold, and all five are here rather than split with the
//! caller: the algorithm is RS256; the signature verifies under the key the
//! header names; the issuer is Apple; the audience is this app; and the token
//! has not expired.
//!
//! ## Why the key set is cached the way it is
//!
//! Two rules, and each closes what the other opens. A cached set is dropped
//! after [`KEY_SET_TTL`] so a key Apple has withdrawn stops verifying tokens
//! within the hour. A `kid` the cache does not know forces a refetch, so a key
//! Apple has just rotated *in* works immediately rather than after that hour —
//! but no more often than [`MIN_REFETCH_INTERVAL`], because the `kid` is a value
//! the caller writes, and without the floor a stream of invented ids would be a
//! stream of requests to Apple with this server's name on them.
//!
//! ## What this deliberately does not read
//!
//! The `nonce` claim. Binding a token to a challenge this server issued would
//! stop one being replayed, and it buys nothing here: the token is already bound
//! to an audience and an expiry, and what a replay would achieve is signing in
//! as the person who owns the token — which requires their device to have
//! produced it in the first place. A nonce becomes worth it when a sign-in
//! grants something a replay could steal; today it grants access to the
//! attacker's own history.
