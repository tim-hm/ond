/// bind the row — so `bound_to` carries what was actually proved, and a binding

/// answer [`claim`] gives the same person arriving by the other branch.
/// Possession of an anonymous id is the whole of the claim to it (`identity.rs`
/// says so), and that is not a credential this may weigh against a signed-in one.
///
/// Three sub-rules, each following from the schema rather than from taste:
///
/// - **`sessions` and `bolt_scores`** reparent, skipping a row `into` already
///   has. Both are keyed `(user_id, client_<thing>_id)` over an id the *client*
///   minted, so a key held on both sides is one record that reached the server
///   twice — never two things that happened. Written as a `NOT EXISTS` guard
///   because `ON CONFLICT` belongs to `INSERT` and this is an `UPDATE`; the rows
///   it skips are left on `from` and go with the `ON DELETE CASCADE` below, which
///   is the same outcome by a shorter route than deleting them here.
/// - **`user_techniques`** reparent outright, with no guard. Their ids are
///   server-minted rather than client-minted, so two rows can never be one
///   record that arrived twice — and an exercise somebody wrote is the one thing
///   here that exists nowhere else, so there is nothing to reconstruct if it
///   goes. This can leave `into` holding more than `MAX_TECHNIQUES`, which is
///   deliberate: that ceiling gates composing another, and enforcing it here
///   would mean deleting somebody's work to make a number true.
/// - **`assistant_usage`** sums on a shared date. It is a spend limit, counted
///   per person per UTC day, so keeping `into`'s count would let signing in
///   launder whatever `from` had already spent — the same fan-out
///   `entitlement::service`'s `TRANSFER_COOLDOWN` exists to stop, reached by
///   another door.
/// - **Entitlements are not copied.** They are columns on `users` rather than a
///   child table, so deleting `from` releases its
///   `app_store_original_transaction_id` outright, and the client resubmits its
///   `StoreKit` transaction on every launch — `entitlement::service::claim` then
///   grants it to `into` against no holder at all. Copying them would mean
///   reasoning about `users_app_store_original_transaction_id_key` and the
///   transfer cooldown for an outcome the next launch produces by itself.
///
/// Every statement is in the caller's transaction. Half a merge is a person whose
/// sessions moved and whose breath-test history did not, with nothing left to
/// tell anyone it happened.
///
/// ## Why `from` is locked first
///
/// The lock is not tidiness, and its position above the reparents is the whole of
/// what it does. A sync landing on `from` at the same moment — the same device,
/// which has not been told its id is about to change — inserts a child row, and
/// that insert takes `FOR KEY SHARE` on `from`'s `users` row for the life of its
/// transaction. Nothing in the reparents conflicts with that lock, so without the
/// `FOR UPDATE` below the sequence is: the reparent runs against a snapshot taken
/// before the insert committed and does not see it, the insert commits, and the
/// `DELETE` then destroys it through `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Silent, and precisely
/// the history this function exists to preserve.
///
/// `FOR UPDATE` conflicts with `FOR KEY SHARE`, so taking it here makes the merge
/// wait for an in-flight write instead of stepping over it — and because each
/// statement takes its own snapshot under READ COMMITTED, the reparents that
/// follow the lock see everything it waited for. A write that starts *after* the
/// lock is held blocks, and then fails its foreign key once `from` is gone rather
/// than being cascaded away; the client resends under the id it has by then
/// adopted, which is the outcome that loses nothing.
///
/// It doubles as the existence check the `DELETE` would otherwise need — no row to
/// lock is a caller whose identity vanished between the middleware creating it and
/// this write — and it reads the binding the anonymity check turns on, so proving
/// `from` anonymous costs no statement of its own.
