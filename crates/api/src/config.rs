//! between a developer's machine and a deployment without anything noticing — a
//! derived value cannot drift, because there is only one of it.
//!
//! Nothing here configures the assistant. Its credentials are the EC2 instance
//! profile, which the AWS SDK finds through its default credential chain

//! variable the principle would have admitted — a provider key — does not
//! exist, and a laptop and a deployment cannot end up talking to different
