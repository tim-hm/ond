//! What one caller may spend, and the two budgets that bound it.
//!
//! Nothing in front of this process rations anything: `infra/box/Caddyfile`
//! reverse-proxies without a limit, and stock `caddy:2` has none to switch on —
//! its rate limiter is an `xcaddy` plugin, which would mean a second image and a
//! second `docker save | ssh docker load` leg in a deploy that deliberately has
//! one of each (docs/deployment.md). So the ration lives here, where it ships
//! with the binary it protects and `tests/e2e` can drive it.
//!
//! Two budgets rather than one, because the two things worth bounding grow at
//! different rates. [`Throttle::spend_request`] bounds how hard a caller may
//! work the boards, whose queries read the fastest-growing table in the schema.
//! [`Throttle::spend_new_identity`] bounds how many `users` rows a caller may
//! bring into existence, which a request budget alone only slows: at any rate a
//! real client could want, a loop over fresh UUIDs still fills the volume, and
//! every row it leaves behind carries its own assistant allowance and therefore
//! its own Bedrock spend.
//!
//! Top-level rather than inside a feature for the reason `identity` is: it sits
//! under all of them, and one of its two callers *is* `identity`.
