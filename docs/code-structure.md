# Code Structural Strategy

How code is organised across the repo. The same philosophy governs Rust crates and Swift packages; only the idioms differ.

## Guiding Principle

**Couple along the axis of change.** When a feature changes, the blast radius should be one directory. Code is organised feature-first, layer-second: the primary unit is a domain feature (`technique`, later `session`, `streak`); within a feature, code is subdivided by concern. Transport protocols (gRPC, HTTP) and UI layers (views, models) are dimensions _within_ a feature, not containers for features.

### Why not layer-first?

Layer-first groups code by technical role, and fragments features as the codebase grows — one change touches `handlers/`, `services/`, `repositories/`, `types/`. Feature-first inverts this:

```text
# Rust
crates/api/src/features/technique/
  mod.rs
  handlers/grpc.rs
  service.rs   repository.rs   types.rs   errors.rs

# Swift
ios/Ond/Features/Techniques/
  TechniqueListView.swift
ios/Packages/OndCore/Sources/OndKit/
  TechniqueListModel.swift
```

A developer can understand — or delete — a feature by looking in one place.

Swift splits one layer further than Rust: the view stays in the app feature directory, but its observable model lives in `OndKit`. The app target has no test bundle — package tests are the only tests that run on the host — so a model in the app target would be structurally untestable.

## The layering contract

Inside a Rust feature, three layers with fixed responsibilities:

| Layer           | Receives                                  | Owns                                         | Never does                      |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `handlers/`     | `Arc<AppState>`                           | Transport concerns, auth, request unwrapping | Business rules                  |
| `service.rs`    | `&PgPool` and other explicit dependencies | Validation, orchestration, proto conversion  | Raw SQL; taking `Arc<AppState>` |
| `repository.rs` | `&PgPool`                                 | All SQL                                      | Anything else                   |

A service that takes `Arc<AppState>` can reach anything, which makes its real dependencies invisible at the call site and untestable in isolation. Explicit parameters are the point.

**All SQL is in a `repository.rs`, including outside `features/`.** `crate::identity` is the one tier-2 module that touches the database, and it is a directory — `identity/{mod.rs,middleware.rs,repository.rs}` — rather than a file, so its two queries sit in a repository like every other query in the crate. The exception it would otherwise be ("all SQL is in a `repository.rs`, except that one file") is what turns the rule from a fact into a convention, and a convention is what the next query breaks. A tier-2 module that needs the database escalates to a directory rather than growing a query inline.

Repositories are **free functions**, not a `Repository` struct, and there is no trait abstraction over them. A mocking seam would let a test pass against a query the database would reject — and `sqlx::query_as!` already checks every query against the real schema at compile time, which is the guarantee a mock would be trading away.

## Naming Conventions

The module path provides context — **don't prefix filenames with the feature name.** `technique/handlers/grpc.rs` is unambiguous; `technique/handlers/technique_grpc.rs` is noise.

### Rust

| Element       | Convention                     | Example              |
| :------------ | :----------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Files/modules | snake_case                     | `repository.rs`      |
| Module entry  | `mod.rs`                       |                      |
| Doc comments  | `//!` at the top of every file | `//! Technique SQL.` |

### Swift

Swift diverges from Rust here, and deliberately: the language convention is one principal type per file, named after it. Following the Rust convention instead would fight every tool in the ecosystem.

| Element           | Convention                               | Example                        |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| All files         | PascalCase, named for the principal type | `TechniqueListView.swift`      |
| Views             | `-View` suffix                           | `TechniqueListView.swift`      |
| Observable models | `-Model` suffix                          | `TechniqueListModel.swift`     |
| Tests             | `-Tests` suffix                          | `TechniqueDecodingTests.swift` |

## Three-Tier Escalation

Every piece of code has a default home. Start at the lowest tier and escalate only when a **concrete** second consumer exists — never speculatively.

1. **Feature-local** (the default home for all new code) — Rust: `crates/api/src/features/<name>/`. Swift: `ios/Ond/Features/<Name>/`.
2. **App-local** (a second feature in the same target needs it) — Rust: top-level modules like `src/http/`, `src/state.rs`. Swift: `ios/Ond/` root.
3. **Shared crate/module** (a second target needs it) — Rust: a `shared` crate, which **does not exist yet and should not be created until it does**. Swift: a target in `ios/Packages/OndCore` — `OndKit` for domain, `OndUI` for design.

**Rule for tier 2:** if at least two features call into it _and_ its job is to wrap or mediate against an external system (the database, the network), it belongs at the top level. If it owns user-visible domain behaviour, it belongs inside a feature.

## Swift module boundaries

All Swift library code lives in **one** SwiftPM package, `ios/Packages/OndCore`, split into targets. One package rather than three because SwiftPM cannot share a tools-version or platform list across packages — and, more importantly, because each package carries its own `Package.resolved`, so a split means several lockfiles free to pin different versions of the same dependency.

| Target               | Product? | Role                                                                                     | May depend on            |
| :------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `OndAPI`             | **no**   | Generated protobuf + the Connect client factory                                          | Connect, SwiftProtobuf   |
| `OndKit`             | yes      | Domain models, observable feature models, repositories, and the bundled `catalogue.json` | `OndAPI`                 |
| `OndUI`              | yes      | Design tokens and shared components                                                      | nothing                  |
| `OndStyle`           | yes      | Mappings from a domain type onto a design token                                          | `OndKit`, `OndUI`        |
| `OndDiagrams`        | **no**   | Redraws the site's figures (executable)                                                  | `OndKit`                 |
| `Ond` (iOS)          | —        | Features, composition root                                                               | the three products above |
| `OndWatch` (watchOS) | —        | Features, composition root, the phone link                                               | the three products above |
| `OndActivity` (iOS)  | —        | The Live Activity's views — the lock screen and the Dynamic Island                       | the three products above |

Two invariants hold here, and the target graph enforces both:

- **Neither app can import `OndAPI`.** It is a target, not a product, so the module is not merely undeclared in `project.yml` — it is unnameable from an app. "App code never imports a generated protobuf type" is checked by the compiler rather than remembered.
- **Nor `OndDiagrams`.** Same mechanism, same reason: it is a development-time tool, and a development-time tool must not be able to drift into a shipping binary.
- **`OndUI` knows nothing about the domain.** It has no dependencies at all. It exposes accents named for feeling (`settle`, `night`, `spark`, `restore`), and something above it maps `TechniqueGoal` onto them — a design module that imported domain types would invert the dependency and make the palette un-reusable. `OndStyle` is where that mapping lives, which is the point of it existing: it can name both sides precisely because nothing depends on _it_.

### The widget extension

`OndActivity` is a third target over the same three products, and it is a target rather than more app code for a reason that is not ours: a Live Activity is drawn out of process. The app requests and updates it (`OndKit/SessionActivity.swift`); the extension renders it, and can reach nothing else in the app at all.

That gives the pair exactly one seam — the payload — and it lives in `OndKit` as `SessionPresence` so both halves name one type instead of keeping two copies of a struct in step. The lock-screen controls are the one deliberate exception to that rule: `OndActivity/Intents/` is compiled into _both_ targets, because a `LiveActivityIntent` has to be resolvable from the app's own App Intents metadata even though the button that sends it is drawn in the extension. `SessionControlIntents.swift`'s doc comment carries the detail.

The other half of the seam is what is deliberately not shared. The extension's views are its own, by the same rule that keeps the wrist's views off the phone: a lock screen glanced at mid-breath is a different surface from a screen being watched, and `BreathCue` is a ring sweeping one phase where `BreathVisual` is an orb inside a session ring.

### What the two apps share

`OndWatch` is a second app over the same package. Everything platform-neutral is already in `OndKit` and the watch composes the same instances — the session timeline, the catalogue cache, the local session store, the sync queue. Views are never shared: a wrist is not a small phone, and `BreathRing` exists precisely because there is only room for one shape where the phone has two.

What falls between the two is a mapping from a domain type onto a design token. `OndUI` cannot hold one by the invariant above, so `OndStyle` does: it depends on both products, which is exactly what lets it name a `TechniqueGoal` and an accent in the same function. `GoalAccent` lives there and both apps read it, so the wrist and the hand cannot drift to different colours for the same technique.

The line is between a **mapping** and a **view**. A mapping goes in `OndStyle`; a view stays duplicated per target, because a wrist is not a small phone and the two really do want different layouts. `SafetyNote` is what duplicates today, and it should stay that way until its bodies stop diverging rather than because it is small.

`FigureShape` is the pair that crossed the line. The phone and the watch each had their own renderer turning a technique's drawing commands into a `Path`, and the copies differed only in a line width — mechanical enough that `OndStyle` now holds one and both apps call it. What stays per target is everything above it: sizes, labels, and how much of a figure a surface chooses to show.

The same rule catches one pair the compiler cannot see at all: the app's figures and the marketing site's. Both are drawn from `OndKit/TechniqueFigure.swift`, and the site's SVGs are generated from it by `mise run generate:diagrams` rather than hand-authored beside it. `mise run check:diagrams` fails on any drift, which is the only reason the two can be trusted to agree — the arrangement it replaced was a coordinate-for-coordinate port of `web/index.html` with nothing checking the copy. It sits outside `mise run check` because it builds Swift, so it is one of the tasks to run when touching `ios/` or `web/` — and it runs on CI's macOS job beside `check:swift`, because an invariant whose only enforcement is a human habit is not enforced.

The link between the two apps carries coordination, never practice. The rule, in one line: **a session record only ever reaches the server, and only ever from the device that recorded it.** The server upserts idempotently on the client-minted id, so both devices write and each restores the other's history; what rides the pairing is what the wire cannot carry — who this person is, the one number measured on a screen the wrist does not have, the requests one device makes of the other, and the sensor readings that are worth nothing a minute after they were taken.

Three channels, chosen by what a lost payload costs:

| Channel | Semantics | Carries |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `updateApplicationContext` (phone → watch) | last-value-wins, replayed on every activation | `WatchHandoff`: the identity, the mirrored best pause, the erase flag, a pending `WatchSessionOrder` |
| `sendMessage` / `transferUserInfo` (watch → phone) | best-effort, lossy, live | the order's ack, each heart-rate reading, and the notice that an ordered session finished |
| gRPC-Web to the API | idempotent, retried, offline-first | every `SessionRecord` and check-in score |

Three rules hold that shape, and all three have teeth:

- **One writer to `applicationContext`.** It is a single dictionary, wholly replaced per write, so everything outbound goes through the one `WatchHandoffOutbox`. A second writer clobbers the identity the wrist depends on for everything else.
- **State the system replays is not an event.** The context is redelivered on every activation, so anything in it that _acts_ needs a consumer that fires once: `erasesPriorHistory` guards on the identity having changed, and an order goes through `WatchOrderLedger`, which admits an id once and only while it is fresh.
- **Nothing outbound reaches a wrist reliably, so anything the wrist must stop doing rides its own reply.** The phone cannot count on reaching the watch — `sendMessage` needs the watch app frontmost, and a context is delivered whenever the system feels like it. What it can count on is that a wrist still sending has just reached the phone, which is why every `WatchPulse` is answered with a `WatchPulseReply` saying whether more are wanted. A phone killed and relaunched in the background to take one still answers correctly, where a "stop" it never got to send would have left a workout running on somebody's arm.

The watch must never mint an identity of its own, so `ProvisionedUserIdentityStore` starts empty and everything above it works without one — the reasoning is on that type. Standalone is the constraint underneath all of it: a wrist with no phone in range still runs sessions, records them, and syncs them itself.

The radios are `ios/Ond/WatchLink.swift` and `ios/OndWatch/PhoneLink.swift`, one `WCSession` delegate per process, and both stay thin — what a payload _means_ lives in `OndKit` (`WatchHandoffOutbox`, `WatchHandoffInbox`, `WatchOrderLedger`, `WristLaunchModel`, `WristOrderModel`, `OrderedMoment`, `PulseMonitor`, `PulseRelay`), which is what makes it testable on the host. `WristLauncher` reads `WCSession.isPaired` without being one of the delegates, which the one-writer rule permits because it only ever reads. Neither app target has a test bundle, so anything left in one is untested by construction — which is why an ending that has to survive a dark screen belongs on a model and not on a `.onChange`.

## Module Size Tiers

Choose structure from a feature's actual complexity. Don't impose it preemptively.

- **Tier 1** (< ~150 LOC, single concern) — everything in one file. No subdirectories, no module file.
- **Tier 2** (150–500 LOC, or 3+ concerns) — the module file becomes pure declaration + re-export; logic moves to named siblings. `features/technique/` is here.
- **Tier 3** (500+ LOC, multiple surfaces) — nested subdirectories per concern.

`mod.rs` contains `mod` declarations and `pub use` re-exports only. If it grows past ~50 lines, logic has leaked in.

## Test Placement

Unit tests are colocated with their source in both languages.

- **Rust** — inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of the file under test.
- **Swift** — `ios/Packages/OndCore/Tests/<Target>Tests/`, which is where SwiftPM requires them.

Integration tests are the exception, because they belong to no single file: `crates/api/tests/e2e/` mirrors the feature layout one level up — `technique.rs` for the feature, `health.rs` for the JSON surface, `harness.rs` for the shared machinery. Cargo treats `tests/e2e/main.rs` as one target, so all of them compile into a single binary rather than one per file.

This is why `crates/api` has a `lib.rs` at all. An integration test cannot reach into a binary crate, so `main.rs` holds process startup and nothing else, and the router it serves is assembled in `lib.rs` where the harness can build the same one.

## Invariants

These hold at every tier, in both languages:

- **Axis of change**: a feature change touches at most two top-level directories — the feature's, and possibly one shared location.
- **Deletability**: removing a feature directory removes > 80% of that feature's code.
- **No backdoor imports**: nothing bypasses a feature's public surface.
- **No circular feature dependencies**: if A imports from B, B must not import from A.
- **Dependencies flow inward**: features depend on shared infrastructure, never the reverse.
- **Generated types stop at the repository boundary** (see [transport.md](transport.md)).
- **No junk drawers**: `utils/` and `helpers/` directories must not exist. If shared logic has no obvious home, that's a signal to think harder — most premature abstractions dissolve once features own their own code.
