## Components

| Component                  | Role                                                                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `proto/`                   | The API contract. The only description of the wire format.                                                                                              |
| `crates/api`               | The service. Serves gRPC-Web on `/ond.v1.*` and JSON on `/health`, `/about`.                                                                            |
| `crates/migrate`           | Owns the schema and the seeded technique catalogue. Runs to completion and exits.                                                                       |
| `…/OndCore/Sources/OndAPI` | Generated protobuf and the Connect client factory. Not a package product, so only OndKit can reach it.                                                  |
| `…/OndCore/Sources/OndKit` | Domain types, observable models, and repositories. The only Swift code that touches generated types.                                                    |
| `…/OndCore/Sources/OndUI`  | Spacing and accent tokens. Domain-free.                                                                                                                 |
| `ios/Ond`                  | The iOS app: composition root plus features.                                                                                                            |
| `ios/OndWatch`             | The watchOS app: the same session over the same package, plus the `WatchConnectivity` link that hands it an identity.                                   |
| `web/`                     | The one-pager plus the privacy and support pages. Static at serve time, but its figures are generated — Caddy serves it beside the API on one hostname. |
| `infra/`                   | OpenTofu for the single box everything above is deployed onto, plus what runs on it. See [deployment.md](deployment.md).                                |

### Backend features

Each is `crates/api/src/features/<name>/`, laid out handler → service → repository. Only the first is readable without an identity.

| Feature          | Role                                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `technique`      | The catalogue: techniques, the stages and phases they play, and the breathing foundations served alongside them.                      |
| `profile`        | What onboarding collected, from goals down to the display name a leaderboard prints.                                                  |
| `journey`        | Sessions, controlled-pause scores, streaks, and leaderboards — all derived on read from two append-only tables.                       |
| `assistant`      | A language model reading the profile and the catalogue, and the rules that answer when it cannot. The only feature that spends money. |
| `entitlement`    | App Store transactions verified against Apple's chain, stored as the tier and expiry `assistant` gates on.                            |
| `account`        | Sign in with Apple, verified server-side and bound to `users.apple_user_id`. Plus `DeleteAccount`'s erasure.                          |
| `user_technique` | The exercises a person composed for themselves, bounded by the safe ranges the seeded catalogue publishes.                            |

## Decisions worth knowing

**PostgreSQL enums, not text columns.** `technique_goal` and `phase_kind` are native enums. The proto contract already fixes both value sets, so the database rejecting a fifth value at write time is strictly better than it reaching a client as something unmapped.

**Stages and phases are child tables.** A technique owns ordered `technique_stages`, and each stage owns ordered `technique_phases` — both keyed on `(…, ordinal)` rather than held as a JSON column on `techniques`. The session is queried as a set and its shape is fixed by the contract; JSON would buy schema flexibility this data does not want, at the cost of the ordering guarantee the keys provide for free. A plain cyclic technique is one stage; the Wim Hof-style protocol, where a retention the person ends sits between fast breaths and a recovery hold, is why the level exists at all.

**The catalogue lives in code.** `crates/migrate/src/seed.rs` holds the nine techniques and the breathing foundations, and reconciles them into the database on every run. They are curated reference data, not user content — editing a summary there and re-running `mise run migrate` is the supported way to change one.

**No `shared` crate.** With one service there is no second consumer, so there is nothing to share. Create it when a second crate genuinely needs a type, not before.

**Identity is possession of a UUID.** The client mints one on first launch, keeps it in the Keychain so it survives a reinstall, and sends it as the `ond-user-id` header on every RPC. `crates/api/src/identity/` resolves it as middleware — the module's `//!` has the three outcomes and [transport.md](transport.md) has where the layer sits in the stack and why. Every feature but one requires it: `profile`, `journey`, `entitlement`, `assistant`, `account` and `user_technique`. `TechniqueService` deliberately does not, because gating the catalogue would gate the app's first screen on a Keychain write.

On the request path there is still no token and no signature: possession of the id is the whole claim, and that is the trade V1 makes for an anonymous row. It is no longer the only credential, though — `features/account/` writes `users.apple_user_id`, the column the trade left waiting, once it has verified the caller's Apple identity token against Apple's published keys (`account/verifier/apple.rs`). It attaches and moves nothing else: signing in is never required, and it exists so a person on a new device is handed back a history a fresh anonymous id cannot reach. Which id survives when the Apple account already has one, and which sign-in is refused rather than merged, is `account::repository::bind_apple_account`.

A well-formed id is a claim anybody can make, so `crates/api/src/throttle.rs` rations what one caller may spend: one budget on requests, a far tighter one on creating `users` rows. Its `//!` argues the split and where each number comes from.

**The catalogue's paid tier is advisory.** `ListTechniques` takes no identity and returns every technique whole, with `requires_subscription` as one boolean per row that nothing server-side enforces. A session runs entirely on the device, so a gate here would withhold nothing it costs anything to serve; what does cost money is the language model, and `entitlement` guards that one against the caller's own row. The field's zero value is deliberately _unlocked_ for the same reason, argued at the field itself in `proto/ond/v1/technique_service.proto`. Genuinely withholding the catalogue would mean a second RPC serving full detail only to entitled callers, with `ListTechniques` cut back to name and summary for locked rows — take that only if the catalogue's breadth becomes the product.

## What runs where

Locally, only PostgreSQL is containerised (`compose.yaml`); the API runs natively under `mise run dev` so a code change rebuilds in seconds. [contributing.md](contributing.md) is the whole of that surface.

Deployed, everything is containerised on one box provisioned by OpenTofu from `infra/`: the API, Postgres, and a Caddy that fronts both the RPC surface and `web/`. There is still no Kubernetes and no Tilt — one box is the deliberate ceiling for V1, and [deployment.md](deployment.md) has the topology and, more usefully, where each of its decisions runs out.
