## Product

| Doc | When to read |
| :-- | :-- |
| [product/business-plan.md](product/business-plan.md) | What we are building, for whom, and how it pays for itself. |
| [product/naming.md](product/naming.md) | The market-facing name: shortlist and validation checklist. |
| [product/listing.md](product/listing.md) | Before typing anything into App Store Connect: the description and promotional text, why they read as they do, and which fields are required. |
| [product/breathing-science.md](product/breathing-science.md) | Before changing a technique's mechanism or evidence copy, adding a technique or occasion, or writing for any population or condition — every claim the catalogue makes, the trials behind it, and the claims it refuses. |
| [product/home-sentence.md](product/home-sentence.md) | Before changing Home's one line of state: the cases, the exact strings, the order they are tested in, and the cases that deliberately say nothing. |
| [product/breathing-foundations.md](product/breathing-foundations.md) | Before changing The basics — the claim-by-claim evidence, limitations, word budgets and presentation rule behind the page. |
| [product/session-summary.md](product/session-summary.md) | Before changing what a session says when it ends: the cases, the exact strings, which figures are shown, and when the mood check is skipped. |
| [product/watch-consent.md](product/watch-consent.md) | Before changing what the watch asks before a first session: the words it uses, when the phone's agreement stands in for its own, and what a deletion does to both. |

## Documentation policy

**Document rationale next to the pattern.** There is no separate decision log. When a design decision is made, the reasoning goes in the doc that covers that area, or in the doc comment on the code itself. A decision log rots because nothing forces it to be read; a paragraph above the code that surprised you gets read by the next person to touch it.

**Keep docs verifiable.** Reference specific file paths and type names. Prefer pointing at code over describing behaviour that can drift from it — `mise run check:doc-links` catches a path that stops resolving, but nothing catches a paragraph that quietly stopped being true.

Nor does the check reach as far as it looks: `lychee` resolves **markdown links**, so a path written as prose in backticks is invisible to it — which is how `transport.md` went on placing `GrpcWebLayer` in `main.rs` after it had moved to `lib.rs`, with the gate green throughout. Make a path to a document a link, so the check does see it. A path to code stays a claim only a person can check.

**New cross-cutting pattern?** Create or update the doc, then add a row to the table in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) §2. A pattern nobody can find is a pattern nobody follows.
