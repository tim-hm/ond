# Testing

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration. — Guillermo Rauch

Each clause is doing work:

- **Write tests** — every non-obvious decision should be pinned by something that fails when it is undone.
- **Not too many** — a test has a permanent cost. It must be read, maintained, and understood before any change to the code it covers. Tests that restate the implementation charge that cost and return nothing.
- **Mostly integration** — the defects that reach users live at the seams: a proto enum that decodes to the wrong case, a query whose column type changed. Unit tests rarely span a seam.

## What not to test

- **Trivial CRUD.** A repository function that is one `SELECT` with no logic is verified by `sqlx::query_as!` at compile time — more thoroughly than a test could.
- **Type conversions with no rules.** A struct-to-struct copy where every field maps by name.
- **Thin wrappers.** If the function's whole body is a call to something else, the test asserts that Rust can call a function.
- **Framework behaviour.** axum routing, SwiftUI layout, and sqlx connection pooling are tested by their authors.

Ask instead: _if this broke, would anything else notice?_ If a compile error, a failing query, or a visibly broken screen would catch it first, the test is redundant.

## What is worth testing

The existing tests are the pattern:

| Test                                                   | Guards                                                                                                 |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `carries_the_query_string_onto_the_maintenance_url`    | Dropping the query string would silently change the maintenance connection's TLS mode                  |
| `no_domain_goal_maps_to_unspecified`                   | The proto zero value never escapes as a real enum case                                                 |
| `slugs_are_unique`                                     | The seed upsert is keyed on `slug`; a duplicate would make array order decide which definition wins    |
| `rejectsAnUnspecifiedGoal`                             | The Swift side of the same boundary — a newer server cannot put a technique in the wrong section       |
| `a_forged_chain_does_not_verify`                       | A structurally perfect App Store transaction that is nobody's but its author's entitles nobody         |
| `the_compiled_in_root_is_apples`                       | The one trust anchor with no runtime check behind it; a swapped file would refuse every real buyer     |
| `each_product_buys_its_own_tier`                       | Two ids decide who reaches the model; a typo in either is a purchase that quietly buys the wrong thing |
| `the_free_techniques_are_the_two_that_cannot_go_wrong` | Nobody is guided through the free tier, so it may hold only techniques carrying no safety caution      |

Every one covers a decision that is invisible in the code and expensive to rediscover.

## Conventions

**Rust** — inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the bottom of the file under test. Names are declarative sentences (`doubles_embedded_quotes`), and a `///` doc comment states the regression the test guards when that isn't obvious from the name. `clippy.toml` re-allows `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic` inside tests, where panicking _is_ the reporting mechanism.

**Swift** — Swift Testing, in each package's `Tests/`. `@Suite` and `@Test` carry prose descriptions, because those strings are what a failure prints.

Swift tests run on the **host**, not a simulator — every package declares a macOS platform alongside iOS specifically to make that possible. A decoding test should not need a booted device.

## Integration tests

`crates/api/tests/e2e/` drives the router `build_app` assembles — the same one the binary serves — over a real Postgres. It is the only place the whole slice is exercised at once: rows in Postgres → repository → service → tonic → gRPC-Web framing → a decoded protobuf message.

**The disposable database.** Each test calls `TestDatabase::create("<name>")`, which derives its connection from `DATABASE_URL` by _replacing_ the database with `ond_test_<name>_<run stamp>`. The dev database is therefore unreachable from here by construction, not by convention — these tests drop wholesale. The run stamp is what lets two gate runs proceed at once without dropping each other's databases; a failing test's database survives for post-mortem inspection (find it as `ond_test_<name>_*`) until the harness sweeps databases from runs more than an hour past — along with anything under `ond_test_` it did not mint, so do not park a scratch database there. cargo-nextest runs each test in its own process, which is what makes one database per test the natural unit.

**Why `oneshot` rather than a listener.** The harness drives the assembled `Router` directly through `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot`. The layer stack under test — `GrpcWebLayer`, CORS, tonic's routes — _is_ the server's behaviour; binding a port would add hyper, a background task, and a shutdown race in order to test code we don't own.

**Why the real gRPC-Web framing.** `harness::call_grpc_web` writes the length-prefixed frame and parses the trailer frame by hand, exactly as the Swift client does. gRPC-Web reports call outcomes in trailers, so a _failed_ call still returns HTTP 200 — a harness that called `service::list_techniques` directly could never catch an error that fails to reach the client.

Every test in `crates/api/tests/e2e/` carries a `///` naming the regression it guards, so the files are the inventory. What follows is a reading order through them — the calls where the decision being pinned is invisible in the code under test. An absent row means a routine test, not an unjustified one.

| Test                                                         | Guards                                                                                                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `the_seeded_catalogue_arrives_over_grpc_web`                 | The bootstrap's acceptance criterion, minus the simulator                                                                           |
| `the_wim_hof_rounds_arrive_as_ordered_stages`                | Stage order, the open-ended flag, and per-stage cycles — the whole reason the stage model exists                                    |
| `phase_dial_ranges_reach_the_client`                         | Every phase arrives with a range containing its default, so a client can render a dial from it                                      |
| `the_foundations_arrive_over_grpc_web`                       | The second RPC, and that the foundations keep their curated reading order                                                           |
| `phase_order_follows_ordinal_not_insertion_order`            | The service groups phases through a `HashMap`; the fixture inserts a cycle out of order so ignoring `ordinal` fails                 |
| `a_stageless_technique_fails_the_call_rather_than_vanishing` | A corrupt row surfaces as a non-zero `grpc-status`, not a quietly shortened list                                                    |
| `health_answers_without_a_reachable_database`                | `/health` is liveness-only; its pool points at a dead port, so answering at all proves it issued no query                           |
| `the_first_rpc_creates_the_row_and_later_ones_reuse_it`      | The lazy upsert from both sides — a `DO UPDATE` would pass the first assertion and wipe the profile in the second                   |
| `the_catalogue_stays_public`                                 | The one service readable with no identity, and still refusing a header that claims one and fails to parse                           |
| `a_taken_display_name_is_suffixed_rather_than_refused`       | Two people called Tim is the normal case; the stored name can differ from the requested one, and the response says so               |
| `profiles_are_scoped_to_the_calling_identity`                | No id travels in the request, so the only way this breaks is a layer reading the wrong header                                       |
| `a_local_day_is_the_callers_day_not_utc`                     | Why the offset travels per request: the same two rows are a streak or a single late evening depending on where they were breathed   |
| `an_impossible_session_fails_the_whole_batch`                | A client that sent one impossible session has a bug, and storing the rest would hide it behind a gap nobody can find                |
| `a_board_ranks_everyone_and_names_only_the_opted_in`         | The opt-in from both sides: somebody unnamed still sees where they stand, which is what makes a board worth joining                 |
| `only_real_slugs_reach_the_client`                           | A model naming a technique that does not exist must not be able to put that name in front of anyone                                 |
| `an_exhausted_quota_answers_from_the_rules`                  | The spend ceiling binds, and running out is a flagged answer rather than an error                                                   |
| `the_breaker_trips_and_then_recovers`                        | Both halves, through the call count — a breaker that never opened and one that never closed both still answer                       |
| `the_explanation_streams_ordered_chunks`                     | Separate frames, in order, over the real gRPC-Web framing — what a client accumulating text depends on                              |
| `only_coach_reaches_the_model`                               | The one thing the server spends money on, gated on the caller's own row rather than on anything a request carries                   |
| `resubmitting_the_same_transaction_changes_nothing`          | The client resubmits on every launch; the expiry not moving is what says the grant was not applied twice                            |
| `an_upgrade_is_not_shadowed_by_a_longer_cheaper_period`      | Why the ordering key is `signedDate`: a Plus→Coach upgrade's expiry is _earlier_ than the period it replaces                        |
| `a_refund_ends_only_the_subscription_it_paid_for`            | A late refund for a lapsed subscription must not end the one somebody is currently paying for                                       |
| `the_free_techniques_arrive_unlocked_and_the_rest_do_not`    | The free tier is a promise, and one boolean per row is the whole of it on the wire                                                  |
| `the_occasions_arrive_as_prescriptions_into_the_catalogue`   | Two occasions differing only in delivery surface — lose that field and both still read as sensible entries, one of them mid-meeting |
| `the_progression_orders_the_catalogue_without_gating_it`     | The half of "suggestive, never gating" that is an absence: the techniques the ordering omits arrive on the same call regardless     |

Each of these was verified by breaking the code it covers and confirming it fails.

## Running them

```bash
mise run test        # everything
mise run test:rs     # Rust unit tests — no database, no network
mise run test:e2e    # integration tests; starts Postgres if it isn't running
mise run test:swift  # Swift Testing, on the host
mise run test:system # live Swift/backend smoke plus iPhone accessibility UI tests
mise run coverage    # informational Rust and Swift summaries; no percentage gate
```

`test:rs` and `test:e2e` are both part of `mise run check`, which is why the gate needs Docker. `test:swift` is not, because it needs the Xcode toolchain — run it when you touch `ios/`. In Xcode, ⌘U runs the same suites — the scheme's Test action is wired to the package's test target.

## System tests and coverage

`test:swift:live` expects the API at `http://localhost:18100` and proves the real Swift gRPC-Web client can decode its seeded catalogue. `test:ui:phone` expects a booted iOS simulator and audits Home and an active Coherent Breathing session. `test:system` owns the local API lifecycle and runs both; it refuses to replace a process already listening on port 18100.

`coverage:rs` exercises the Rust unit and e2e suites. `coverage:swift` measures the host Swift package's first-party modules and excludes generated code, dependencies, tests, and development executables. The reports are information, not release gates, and their detailed data stays in ignored build directories.

## What remains outside automation

The UI suite covers the iPhone's Home and active-session surfaces. It does not cover watchOS, purchases, or the full catalogue and settings navigation.

**No test verifies a real Apple signature**, and none can: minting one needs Apple's private key, and a transaction captured from a sandbox purchase would go stale as soon as its certificate chain rotated. The boundary is drawn deliberately. What _is_ covered is every rejection path — a forged chain, an unsigned token, a malformed one, another app's bundle id, another product — plus the identity of the compiled-in root, so a swapped or truncated certificate fails on the host rather than in production. What is _not_ covered is the accept path: that a genuine Apple chain verifies has only ever been observed by a sandbox purchase on a device. Simulator purchases cannot close it either — Xcode's local StoreKit configuration signs with a per-machine test certificate, which this server correctly refuses.
