# önd

A minimalist iOS app for breathing techniques — to calm down, get to sleep, find energy, or reset after a spike.

Native SwiftUI clients for iPhone and Apple Watch, a Rust backend, and PostgreSQL, sharing one Protobuf contract.

```bash
mise install        # every pinned tool
mise run migrate    # Postgres up, schema applied, catalogue seeded
mise run dev        # API on :18100
mise run ios:open   # generate the Xcode project and open it
```

Full setup, including the one-time `xcode-select` step, is in [docs/contributing.md](docs/contributing.md).
