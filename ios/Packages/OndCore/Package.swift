import PackageDescription

// One package with several targets — not one package per module. SwiftPM offers no way to
// share a tools-version or a platform list across packages, so a split would
// mean maintaining those in triplicate and, worse, one `Package.resolved` per
// package: several lockfiles free to pin different versions of the same
// dependency, which is precisely what a lockfile exists to prevent.
//
// The module boundaries the split was for are enforced better here, by target
// dependencies — see the note on the OndAPI target.

    // macOS is declared alongside iOS so `swift test` runs on the host in
    // seconds. Without it SwiftPM assumes macOS 10.13 and refuses to link
    // Connect, leaving a booted simulator as the only way to run a unit test —
    // which is not a dependency a decoding test should have.
    //
    // watchOS 26 is the floor that pairs with iOS 26 — the watch app ships
    // alongside the phone app, so the two move together rather than the wrist
    // dragging a lower floor into the shared targets. The floor sits at 26
    // because the phone's chrome is built on Liquid Glass — the minimising tab
    // bar — and an unreleased app has no installed base to strand by asking for
    // it unconditionally.
    //
    // The tools-version above is 6.2 for this line alone: `.v26` was not a
    // `SupportedPlatform` case before it, and the string form would trade a
    // checked constant for a literal nothing validates.
    //
    // macOS sits at 15 rather than 14 for one API: `Color.mix(with:by:)`, which
    // `OndStyle` uses to soften a goal accent into the exhale ink. Nothing runs
    // on macOS but the tests, and the floor only has to be low enough that a
    // host can build them — it is not a platform this ships to.
