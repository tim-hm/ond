    /// slate and a moving one in the goal's accent, so a hold is the same colour
    /// on the figure as it is in the session. What the figure adds is direction,
    /// because a line that rises and falls in one colour tells you the shape of
    /// the exercise and nothing about which half you are on.
    ///
    /// The exhale is the accent softened towards the ground rather than a second
    /// hue. Two hues was the first attempt and neither form of it survives
    /// contact with the palette: mixing an accent towards a fixed cool token
    /// turns the warm ones muddy, and handing the exhale a fixed token outright
    /// collides on the calm goal, which already owns the coolest accent there is
    /// — and calm is box breathing, the exercise most people will ever see this
    /// on. Softening along the accent's own hue cannot collide with anything,
    /// and it resolves correctly in both appearances by construction: over white
    /// the exhale pales, over near-black it dims.
    ///
    /// How far it softens is `Theme.Softening.strongest` rather than a number
    /// chosen here, because the fraction that reads as *soft* and the fraction
    /// that still clears 3:1 against the ground are one decision, and this is the
    /// stroke that decision is measured on. Two things the next reader is likely
    /// to try, and neither is an improvement: raising it, when the 0.45 this used
    /// to take is illegal on every accent over white; and splitting it per
    /// appearance, which the palette's own ceiling makes unnecessary and which
    /// would make this the one place in either app reading `colorScheme` by hand.
    ///
    /// **Which ground, though, is not free.** Every ratio behind these choices is
    /// measured against `Theme.Surface.ground`, so a figure drawn on
    /// `accentGround(_:)` — the session player — is not covered by any of it and
    /// does not clear 3:1: the softened exhale falls to 1.83:1 there and the hold
    /// to 2.04:1. Re-inking the figure for that ground is not the way out either,
    /// because the wash carries only two marks above 3:1 and a figure needs four.
    /// A figure on the player wants this ground put back underneath it, which is
    /// exactly what `figureGround()` does — so what this paragraph describes is a
    /// hazard the code now answers, not a reason a figure cannot be drawn there.
