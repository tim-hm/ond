    /// The counterpart to `paletteGround()`, for the screens that wear a
    /// technique's colour rather than the palette's neutral one. The wash goes
    /// over `Theme.Surface.ground` rather than over whatever the presentation
    /// put behind it — a translucent gradient alone would sit on the system's
    /// background, which is pure black at night and paper white by day, and
    /// neither is this palette.
    ///
    /// **Only `Theme.Ink.primary` is legible on it.** The wash drags the ground
    /// towards mid-luminance from whichever end it started, which is precisely
    /// where the quieter inks live: at `Theme.Wash.strongest` they measure
    /// 3.26:1 and 2.40:1, and an accent used as its own text colour falls to
    /// 2.93:1. Normal-size text on this ground therefore carries no
    /// `foregroundStyle` of its own and inherits primary — hierarchy here is
    /// size and weight, because tone is spent on being readable at all.
    ///
    /// Not set as a `foregroundStyle` here, deliberately: the failure this
    /// replaced was explicit `Theme.Ink.secondary` overrides, which beat any
    /// default this could install, so a default would buy nothing and hide
    /// where the ink is decided.
    ///
    /// **Drawings are no better off than text here, and in one way worse.** The
    /// bar for a graphical mark is 3:1 rather than 4.5:1, and even so only
    /// primary and secondary clear it on this ground — an accent at full
    /// strength reaches 2.45:1 and a softened one 1.83:1. Two legible marks is
    /// enough for a control and not enough for a technique figure, which needs
    /// four to tell inhale, exhale, hold and baseline apart. A screen that wants
    /// to draw one puts `Theme.Surface.ground` back underneath it first; see
    /// `TechniqueFigure.Ink.colour(on:)`.
    ///
    /// - Parameter accent: The colour to wash the ground in — a goal's accent
    ///   on the session player. Taken as a `Color` rather than reached for,
    ///   because this module knows nothing about techniques or goals.
