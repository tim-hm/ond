///
/// What it does not have is a `failed` case, and that is the design. The server
/// answers from its own rules whenever the assistant is unreachable, so the only
/// thing left to fail is the network — and a person opening the techniques tab
/// on a train should see the catalogue, not an error about a suggestion they did
/// not ask for. `unavailable` renders as nothing at all.
