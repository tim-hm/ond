/// One stage of a technique that never holds, drawn as a line — lung fullness
/// over time.
///
/// **Slope is the point.** x is duration and y is fullness, so a phase's
/// steepness *is* its length: extended exhale's four-second rise is visibly
/// steeper than its six-second fall, and the asymmetry that names the exercise
/// is stated without a label. This is one construction rather than a library of
/// waveforms — coherent breathing reads as a symmetric sine because its two
/// phases are equal, not because anything here special-cases it.
///
/// Pure geometry: x runs 0...1 across the drawn window, level runs 0 (lungs
/// empty) to 1 (full), or -1...1 when signed. The view maps it to points; this
/// type owns every judgement about what the line shows:
///
/// - **Whole cycles, as many as the window holds.** Slope alone cannot separate
///   coherent breathing from bellows breath — both are one-to-one, so both are
///   symmetric — and the only thing that distinguishes 5½ breaths a minute from
///   twenty fast ones is tempo. Drawing a fixed span of *time* rather than a
///   fixed count of cycles is what puts tempo on the page.
/// - **No phase narrower than `minimumPhaseShare`.** The physiological sigh's
///   0.7-second sip beside its five-second exhale would otherwise render
///   sub-pixel, and the sip is the technique.
/// - **Every segment of an open-ended stage is `dashed`** — its durations
///   describe a typical pass, not a scheduled one, and the line should not
///   promise what the clock will not keep.
