    ///    server that still holds everything.
    /// 2. **A fresh identity next, before anything is awaited.** The old id
    ///    names nothing now, and `identity::resolve` upserts a row for any
    ///    well-formed id it is shown — so a single request that slipped out
    ///    under it would recreate the erased person as an empty stranger. This
    ///    is the rule signing out follows, for a sharper version of the same
    ///    reason.
    /// 3. **Then the local stores**, each of which answers for its own files,
    ///    keys and in-memory copies — and, in the schedules' case, for the
    ///    pending notifications iOS is holding on their behalf, which nothing
    ///    else could take back.
    /// 4. **Then everything holding a copy of the identity**, which is where the
    ///    watch is told — and told *after* the erasure rather than before, so
    ///    the context it is handed carries the fresh id and no personal best,
    ///    rather than the departing person's.
    ///
    /// What survives is the App Store subscription, which is not this app's to
