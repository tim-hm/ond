/// a picture of durations that differ by an order of magnitude — the
/// physiological sigh's 0.7-second sip beside its five-second exhale — and a
/// part that renders sub-pixel is a part the reader is told nothing about.
///
/// The floor is applied by repeated passes rather than in one: lifting the
/// smallest parts up rescales the rest into what remains, which can push a
/// mid-sized part below the floor in turn. Each pass floors at least one more
/// part, so the loop is bounded by the part count.
