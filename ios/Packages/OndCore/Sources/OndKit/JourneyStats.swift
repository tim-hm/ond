///
/// - A day is a **local** calendar day. A session at 23:30 belongs to the day
///   the person was living in, not to tomorrow in UTC.
/// - The **best** streak is the longest run of consecutive days there has ever
///   been. It never decreases.
/// - The **current** streak is a run ending today *or yesterday*. A streak is
///   not broken until a whole local day has passed with no session, so somebody
///   who has not breathed yet this morning has not lost anything.
