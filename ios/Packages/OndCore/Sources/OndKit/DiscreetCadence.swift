/// When a discreet session touches the wrist, and how the silences between
/// those touches grow.
///
/// Discreet mode is not the ordinary session made quieter. Cueing every breath
/// for half an hour is unfollowable by somebody who is also listening and
/// talking, and it becomes furniture long before it becomes help — which is the
/// noise-then-ignored failure the whole delivery mode exists to avoid. What a
/// discreet session delivers instead is a handful of short guided bursts, each
/// `cyclesPerBurst` of the technique's own pattern in the haptic vocabulary the
/// full-screen session already teaches, with nothing at all in between. That
/// reframing is what makes the decay decidable: the thing being spaced out is
/// bursts, not breaths.
///
/// **Why the gaps grow.** `gaps` widens by roughly 1.6× — three, five, eight,
/// thirteen minutes — for two independent reasons, either of which would be
/// enough on its own. Physiologically, coherent breathing does most of its work
/// in the first few minutes; after that it is maintenance rather than
/// intervention, so the help belongs at the front. Attentionally, a fixed
/// interval habituates: by minute twenty a cue every five minutes has become
/// furniture and stops registering at all. Growing gaps are what keeps each one
/// salient, which is the mechanism rather than a refinement of it.
///
/// **Why it is open-loop.** The better-in-principle version reads heart rate off
/// the wrist and re-densifies when stress climbs. Its failure modes are the
/// wrong shape — buzzing at somebody who had already settled, or falling quiet
/// exactly when they are spiralling — where a fixed curve fails predictably. The
/// responsive version is worth having once this one has been lived with.
///
/// **Why these are constants.** Whether 3-5-8-13 actually helps is not
/// assertable. A test can prove the bursts fall where they are meant to and that
/// nothing makes a sound; only wearing it through a real meeting can say whether
/// the curve is right. Naming the numbers here is what makes being wrong cost
/// four numbers rather than an architecture.
