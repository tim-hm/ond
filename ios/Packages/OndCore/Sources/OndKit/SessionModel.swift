/// Drives one session: the clock, the phase the person is in, and the record

/// Two readers of one timeline, each on the clock that suits it. The view reads
/// `elapsed` every frame from `TimelineView(.animation)`; this loop sleeps on a
/// `ContinuousClock` until the next boundary's absolute instant and cues it.
/// Neither accumulates: both derive elapsed time by subtracting from a single
/// anchor, so a late frame or a late wake-up is a late answer rather than a
/// permanent offset — which is what a session of twenty bellows cycles would
/// otherwise collect.
///
/// Two clocks, though, not one. `elapsed` is a position in the plan and
/// `realElapsed` is time the person actually spent, and an open-ended hold is
/// where they come apart: the timeline cannot know how long a retention lasts,
/// so the plan stops at the hold's start while the wall clock keeps running, and
/// `release()` splices the plan back on at the hold's end. Everything the
/// timeline answers — which phase, how far through, how many cycles — stays a
/// pure function of the plan; everything the person is owed a truthful number
/// for, which is the record, comes off the wall clock.
