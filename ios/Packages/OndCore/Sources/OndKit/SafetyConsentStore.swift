/// Replaces `SafetyNoteStore`, and inverts what it was for. That store kept a
/// per-exercise dismissal because the cautions were not one warning repeated —
/// box breathing's was about posture, the Wim Hof rounds' about passing out —
/// so agreeing to one could not be allowed to silence another. The cautions
/// were then consolidated into one screen that names every hazard at once, and
/// the moment there is a single set of words, a single agreement to them is the
/// honest thing to store. What used to be a preference about presentation is now
/// a record of something a person did.
///
/// Two things follow from that, and neither followed from the old store:
///
/// - it is written once and never edited, so there is no `undo`, no `clear`, and
///   no way for a screen to put a dismissal back;
/// - it keeps the words, not a flag. `needsConsent` going false has to be
///   answerable with *what* they agreed to and *when*, months later.
///
/// `UserDefaults` because the record belongs to the install: it is what this
/// device asked and this person answered, it has to survive a relaunch, and it
/// is a few hundred bytes written once. It is deliberately **not** on `Profile`
/// — a profile is answers about the person that sync to the server and restore
/// onto a new device, and consent restored onto a device that never showed the
/// screen is consent nobody gave.
