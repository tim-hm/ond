/// one: the disc scales with the breath, and the ring around it fills with the
/// session. Under Reduce Motion the disc gives way to a ring that fills with the
/// phase — the scaling is exactly the effect that setting exists to stop, and a
/// disc merely frozen would leave the wrist with nothing to follow.
///

/// than instruction — how far through you are, answered by a glance and never
/// competing with whatever is inside it, which is the thing actually being
