/// Without it the app stops getting time the moment the wrist drops, which is
/// the posture most of these techniques are actually done in — the screen dims,
/// the cue loop stops being scheduled, and the taps a person is breathing to
/// silently stop. `WKBackgroundModes: mindfulness` in the target's Info.plist is
/// what makes `start()` succeed at all; see the note there for why that type.
///
/// Nothing here is observable and nothing here is a failure to handle. Expiry,
/// refusal, and a session that never started all land in the same place: the
/// budget is gone, the log says so, and the breathing carries on without it. A
/// person halfway through an exhale is worth more than a tidy invariant, so this
/// type has no way to end a session and no state a view could react to.
