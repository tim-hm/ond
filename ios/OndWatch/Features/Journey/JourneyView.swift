/// has finished — and just as complete with the phone in another room. Once an

/// restore path pulls back what the server has, so a streak counts both wrists
/// and hands rather than only what was breathed here.
///
/// No leaderboards. They are other people, so they need a connection, and a
/// screen that is sometimes blank is not one worth a crown scroll.
