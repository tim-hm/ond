/// It replaced first a coloured disc — which told you nothing, since every
/// technique got the same circle — then a home-grown fullness curve that
/// ignored the phase durations, so box breathing and 4-7-8 were near
/// indistinguishable, and then a table of hand-placed drawings ported from the
/// marketing site. The table went when the site started being generated from
/// `TechniqueFigure` instead: it existed because the site was the reference, and
/// once the arrow points the other way a port is just a copy waiting to go
/// stale.
///
/// Undecorated on purpose. `TechniqueFigure` offers labels and the phone writes
/// them onto the figure, but `in · 4` at wrist size is a smudge and the page
/// beneath already carries the counts as text.
