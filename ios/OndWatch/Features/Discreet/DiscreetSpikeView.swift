    /// Two things about a thirty-minute discreet session are unknowable off a
    /// wrist, and the watch simulator will answer both confidently and wrongly —
    /// exactly as the phone simulator reported a healthy locked-screen session
    /// that did not exist on the device. So they get measured rather than assumed:
    ///
    /// 1. **Does an extended runtime session last half an hour?** These are
    ///    time-limited and the ceiling depends on the session type. A discreet
    ///    session is the longest thing this app would ever ask for, and longer
    ///    than any session the watch runs today.
    /// 2. **Do haptics still arrive after a long silence?** The cadence is
    ///    deliberately sparse, up to thirteen minutes between bursts, and a
    ///    session that stays alive while doing nothing at all is a different
    ///    proposition from one accompanying continuous cueing.
    ///
    /// The log separates the two, which is the whole reason it exists. Each entry
    /// is written by the app *deciding* to tap; whether anything was felt is
    /// something only the person wearing it can say. A burst that appears here and
    /// was not felt means haptics are being withheld; a burst that never appears
    /// means the runtime went away, and the reason it went away is logged beside
    /// it.
    ///
    /// Its own `WKExtendedRuntimeSession` rather than the shipping
    /// `ExtendedRuntime`, deliberately: that type documents having no state a view
    /// can react to, and bending a shipping design to serve a temporary instrument
    /// is how instruments become permanent.
