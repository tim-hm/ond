/// The safety terms on their own, for somebody who onboarded before they
/// existed.
///
/// The alternative was to treat an install that predates this screen as having
/// already agreed, which is the one thing a consent record may not do: no record
/// means not asked, and not asked means ask. Reopening the whole flow would ask
/// five questions they have already answered, so the step is lifted out of it
/// and given the chrome it borrowed from `OnboardingView` — the ground, and one
/// button.
///
/// Shown once. Agreeing writes the record, `needsConsent` never comes back true
/// for these terms, and there is no other way off the screen — no close button,
/// and a full-screen cover cannot be swiped away.
