/// What this install is, the two ways to change it, and the way out.
///
/// A section rather than a screen: signing in is not a gate and never becomes
/// one, so it sits in Settings beside the subscription rather than in front of
/// the app. Local-only is named on the row for the same reason — it is the state
/// most people will stay in, and a row that only offered a button would read as
/// something unfinished rather than as a choice already made.
///
/// The anonymous id sits at the foot of the same section, because it is the
/// thing all of that is true *of*: the account row names the state, the buttons
/// change it, and the id is what the state is attached to either way.
///
/// The deletion below it is the promise the privacy policy makes, and what
/// Guideline 5.1.1(v) requires of an app that offers account creation. Its
/// confirmation has to say what goes *and* what does not, because the one thing
/// it cannot touch is the subscription — a person who deletes their account
/// believing the billing stops has been misled by omission.
///
/// The only place `AuthenticationServices` is touched. Everything the sheet
/// produces is reduced here to the one string the server acts on, which is what
/// leaves `AccountModel` drivable by a test on the host with no Apple sheet
/// anywhere in it.
