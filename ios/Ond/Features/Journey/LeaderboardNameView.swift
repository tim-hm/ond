/// The whole of the leaderboard opt-in: type a name and you are on them; clear
/// it and you are not.
///
/// Said plainly rather than as a toggle labelled "privacy", because that is
/// literally how it works — the server lists only profiles that carry a name,
/// and it never invents one.
///
/// The two fields it shows are also editable under Settings' profile screen, and
/// both drive the same `ProfileEditModel`. Two entry points rather than one
/// because the reason to type a name is the board you are looking at, and this
/// is where that reason can be stated; what must not be duplicated is the rule
/// behind the field, and it is not.
