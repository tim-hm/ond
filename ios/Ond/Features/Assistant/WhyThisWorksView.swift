/// It continues the exercise's own summary rather than sitting behind a heading
/// of its own: the same type, the same ink, directly underneath, so the screen
/// reads as one opening passage instead of two competing ones. Nothing is drawn
/// until there is something to read — no placeholder, no spinner, and no notice
/// when the explanation cannot be fetched, because everything needed to
/// practise is already on the screen above it.
///
/// It costs a model call per visit, which the disclosure this replaced was
/// there to avoid. The quota that guards it is the server's, and running out of
/// it lands on the rule-based answer rather than on an error.
