/// The app's chrome, and the only thing `OndApp` puts on screen: four
/// destinations in the system tab bar.
///
/// Four and no more. Past five the system injects a `More` tab backed by a
/// UIKit list that cannot be customised or removed, and every root here owns a
/// `NavigationStack`, which is the arrangement that bar handles worst. Settings
/// is what that leaves out, and it is left out on purpose: a tab bar is for
/// content sections and settings is not content. It is a gear in Journey's
/// toolbar, beside the screen it configures.
///
/// Coach is a tab rather than the bottom accessory it was first built as. The
/// accessory is a floating shelf in its own glass container — right for a
/// transport control that outlives the screen under it, wrong for a destination,
/// which is what a conversation you navigate to actually is. It carries both
/// rooms — the chat once `SubscriptionTier.assistant` is held, the offer until
/// then, and the basics either way — a door in the same row as the others
/// rather than a thing hovering beside them. That constant is `.free`, so today
/// the door only ever opens on the chat.
///
/// Nothing here tints anything: the chrome wears the accent `OndApp` sets, on
/// every tab. The bar once took the colour of whatever aim Breathe was dialled
/// to, which is a thing home no longer has — a bar that cross-faded on every
/// detent was the busiest thing left on a screen whose argument is stillness.
