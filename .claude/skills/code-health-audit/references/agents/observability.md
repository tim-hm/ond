# Observability & Logging — Review Reference

You are reviewing the codebase for observability: the boundary principle, log level correctness, structured fields, coverage gaps, and sensitive data exposure.

Use finding ID prefix: **OBS**

`docs/observability.md` is the source of truth for the backend and both Swift clients. Read it first — the checks below are its load-bearing rules made checkable, but the doc wins where they differ.

---

## 1. The Boundary Principle

**Log at boundaries, stay silent in between.**

Handlers log outcomes. `service.rs` and `repository.rs` say nothing — they communicate through typed errors, and the boundary that catches one decides whether it is worth a line. A repository that logs its own failure _and_ returns an error produces two records of one event, and the one with context is the one further out.

**What to check:**

- **`tracing::` calls in `service.rs` or `repository.rs`.** Each is a finding unless it is the deliberate exception below.
- **Log-and-propagate.** A function that logs an error and then returns `Err(…)` will be logged again wherever the error is handled. The inner log is the one to delete.
- **Chatty handlers.** The `TraceLayer` span already covers per-request accounting. A handler logging "handling request" on entry is duplicating it.

**The deliberate exception — log before converting.** Each feature's error enum logs server-side faults in its `From<…> for tonic::Status` impl, at the point of conversion. `crates/api/src/features/technique/errors.rs` is the pattern. The reason is specific: the client receives an opaque `internal` status, so a conversion that stays silent leaves the failure unreproducible from outside the process, and the sqlx error is deliberately not forwarded to the client because it can carry table and column names. Check every feature's `errors.rs` against this — a `From` impl that maps a server fault to `Status::internal` without logging the cause is the highest-value finding in this whole reference.

**Severity guide:**

- `From<…> for tonic::Status` mapping a server fault to `internal` with no log of the cause → Warning
- Logging in `service.rs` or `repository.rs` → Warning
- Log-then-propagate producing a double record → Suggestion

## 2. Log Level Correctness

Levels are keyed on a single question: _was this expected?_

| Level   | Means                                                    | Example                                                |
| :------ | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `error` | Unexpected. Something is broken and a human should look. | A query failed against a schema that should support it |
| `warn`  | A handled failure mode. Degraded but understood.         | A dependency was unreachable and the fallback ran      |
| `info`  | A lifecycle milestone. Rare, and permanent.              | "connected to the database", "listening"               |
| `debug` | Detail for an investigation in progress                  | A connection retry attempt                             |
| `trace` | Per-request hot path                                     |                                                        |

**The test for `info`:** would you still want this line after a million requests? "listening" yes; "handled a request" no.

**What to check:**

- Per-request operations at `info`.
- A handled, understood degradation at `error` — the assistant falling back to its rule-based answer when the provider is unreachable is expected behaviour and belongs at `warn`. Every `error` line that fires during normal operation trains people to ignore errors.
- A genuine fault at `debug` or `info`, where it will be filtered out by the default `api=info,tower_http=info,warn`.
- Lifecycle events at `debug`.
- **Retry loops.** `docs/observability.md` fixes the shape: each attempt at `debug`, only the final failure at `warn` or `error`. Ten `warn` lines for a slow Postgres boot that resolved itself is the anti-pattern named in the doc.

**Severity guide:**

- Genuine fault logged below `warn`, where the default filter drops it → Warning
- Expected, handled degradation logged at `error` → Warning
- Every retry attempt logged at `warn`/`error` rather than the final failure only → Warning
- Minor level misassignment (info vs debug) → Suggestion

## 3. Structured Fields

**What to check:**

- **String interpolation instead of fields.** `tracing::error!("query for {} failed", id)` should be `tracing::error!(id = %id, "query failed")`. Values that are enums or IDs are recorded via Display: `goal = %goal`.
- **Field names.** These are fixed by `docs/observability.md` and exist so aggregation works: `error` (never `err`), `duration_ms` for elapsed time, `status` for HTTP status codes. Flag divergent names — `elapsed`, `err`, `time_ms`.
- **Message shape.** A short lowercase phrase, not a sentence: `"connected to the database"`, not `"Successfully connected to the database!"`.
- **`println!` / `eprintln!` / `dbg!` in production code.** All three are denied or warned by the workspace clippy lints (`dbg_macro` at deny), so an occurrence means an `#[allow]` is hiding it — check for that too.
- **Correlation ID.** `docs/observability.md` describes the pattern and states plainly that the helper does not exist yet because `/health` and `/about` are infallible, and that it should be written with the first fallible route. If a fallible HTTP route now exists without it, the deferral has expired — that is a finding, and a good one.

**Severity guide:**

- `dbg!` / `println!` / `eprintln!` in production code → Warning
- String interpolation carrying a value that should be a field → Warning
- A fallible HTTP route with no correlation id in its failure response → Warning
- Divergent field name vs the fixed set → Suggestion
- Message written as a capitalised sentence → Suggestion

## 4. Coverage Gaps

**What to check:**

- **Errors discarded at a boundary.** `let _ = …`, `if let Ok(x) = …` with no `else`, or `.unwrap_or_default()` on a fallible call, where nothing records that it failed. Silent failure is the most expensive kind to diagnose.
- **Decision points with no record.** Code branching on configuration or on a fallback path where nothing says which branch ran. The assistant's provider-versus-fallback choice and the circuit breaker's open/closed transitions are the current examples: a breaker that trips and recovers with no log leaves you unable to tell a degraded window from a quiet one.
- **Boundary operations that swallow.** An external call (the model provider) whose failure is converted to a fallback with no `warn`.
- **Missing cause.** A log carrying an error's message but not the source chain.

**Severity guide:**

- Error discarded with no log and no propagation → Warning
- External-dependency failure converted to a fallback with no `warn` → Warning
- State transition in a breaker or quota with no record → Suggestion
- Log carrying a message but not the error's source chain → Suggestion

## 5. Sensitive Data

Logs must never contain secrets, and this repo has two specific exposures worth checking by name.

**What to check:**

- **AWS credentials.** There is no provider key: the assistant signs its Bedrock calls with credentials the AWS SDK resolves from its default chain — the EC2 instance profile on the box. The SDK's own cache is the only thing that should hold them, because it also refreshes them before they expire. Flag any code that calls `provide_credentials()` and keeps the result, that stores an access key or session token in a struct of this repo's own, or that logs an `SdkConfig` or `Credentials` value. `BedrockClient::connect` probes the chain once at boot and deliberately discards what it gets; a change that starts retaining it is the finding.
- **`DATABASE_URL`.** The only credential `Config` holds, which is why that struct's `Debug` is hand-written rather than derived — re-deriving it re-exposes the password, and `debug_redacts_the_database_password` is the test that fails when someone does. Logging a connection string on a failed connect is the other classic leak — check `crates/migrate/src/main.rs` and any pool construction.
- **The user id.** `ond-user-id` is an anonymous UUID rather than a name or an email, so it is fine to log and useful for correlation. Do not flag it as PII; do flag it appearing in a place that is shared or exported.
- **Prompt and completion text.** The assistant handles free text a person wrote about how they feel. Logging a prompt or a completion body — even at `debug` — puts that text in the log aggregator. Flag any body-level logging of model input or output; log token counts, durations, and outcomes instead.
- **sqlx errors reaching the client.** The inverse of the log-before-converting rule: the detail belongs in the log and must not be forwarded in the `tonic::Status` message, because it can carry table and column names.

**Severity guide:**

- AWS credentials, database URL, or any other credential in a log or an error message → Critical
- sqlx error text forwarded to the client in a `Status` message → Warning
- Assistant prompt or completion body logged at any level → Warning
- Blanket request/response body logging with no field filtering → Warning

## 6. Format and Configuration

**What to check:**

- **Level configuration.** `RUST_LOG` overrides the filter; the default is `api=info,tower_http=info,warn`, chosen at boot in `crates/api/src/obs/trace.rs`. Flag ad-hoc level gating anywhere else — a hand-rolled `if verbose` is a second configuration surface for something already configured.
- **Format selection.** JSON in production, human-readable in dev, decided once in `obs/trace.rs`. Flag any second place that formats log output.
- **New environment variables.** `CLAUDE.md` §1.4 caps the backend at two: `OND_ENV` and `DATABASE_URL`. A third read anywhere — including one that only affects logging — is a convention violation, because it is a value that can differ between a laptop and a deployment without anything noticing. A reintroduced provider key is the specific regression to watch for: the assistant's credentials come from the AWS default credential chain precisely so that no variable names them, and `AWS_REGION` is not an exception — the region is a constant in `config.rs` for the same reason the model id is.
- **Metrics listener.** Prometheus is served on port 29103, separate from the public listener on 29100. Flag the metrics or debug surface appearing on the public router, a host mapping that exposes 29103, or Grafana becoming reachable other than through its loopback-bound tailnet proxy.
- **Bounded transport labels.** HTTP `route` is limited to `/health`, `/about`, `grpc_transport`, and `other`; native gRPC `status` is limited to numeric codes 0–16, with malformed or absent final status mapped to `Unknown` (2). Flag URI-, user-, product-, or error-derived labels that can grow without bound.
- **One completion per request.** HTTP metrics cover JSON and transport/CORS failures, while HTTP-200 gRPC envelopes are excluded and counted once by native gRPC metrics at body completion. Check unary failures, handler refusals, mid-stream failures, bodies ending without trailers, and dropped bodies for omissions or double counting.
- **Census freshness.** Entitlement owns a single-flight 60-second census cache. A failed refresh publishes `NaN` rather than the last good users, subscription, or gross-MRR values. Flag stale-on-error gauges, feature semantics duplicated in `obs`, or a background refresh lifecycle added for a scrape-time concern.

**Severity guide:**

- A metrics or debug endpoint served on the public listener → Warning
- A third environment variable read by the backend, or a reintroduced provider key → Warning
- Ad-hoc level gating or a second log-format decision outside `obs.rs` → Suggestion

## 7. Swift Logging

- **`os.Logger`, one subsystem.** Every logger is constructed through `Logger.init(category:)` on subsystem `xyz.holmie.ond`. Flag a direct subsystem literal, `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier`, or another logger construction path that can file phone and watch records under different subsystems.
- **One closed category vocabulary.** `Log.categories` is the executable registry, and the category table in `docs/observability.md` is its operator-facing description. `mise run check:observability` compares both with active, non-generated production Swift literals. Run it; then inspect naming semantics the mechanical check cannot judge, such as two categories that answer the same operational question.
- **`print()` instead of a logger.** `print` output does not reach the unified log and vanishes outside a debugger session. Flag every occurrence in non-test code.
- **Privacy annotations.** `os_log` redacts interpolated dynamic strings by default and shows them as `<private>`. That is the right default for anything a person typed, and the wrong one for a technique slug or an error code you will need in a bug report — those want `privacy: .public`. Flag values marked `.public` that carry user-authored text, and diagnostic values left redacted where the log is then useless.
- **The boundary principle applies here too.** A repository that logs a decode failure _and_ throws leaves the model's catch block logging it again.
- **Errors swallowed in a `Task` or a `catch`.** A failure that only sets a UI flag with no log is invisible the moment the user dismisses the screen.

**Severity guide:**

- User-authored text logged with `privacy: .public` → Warning
- `print()` used for operational logging in non-test code → Warning
- `catch` block that updates UI state but never logs the cause → Warning
- Divergent subsystem or a semantically duplicate category → Suggestion
- Diagnostic value left redacted, making the log unusable → Suggestion
