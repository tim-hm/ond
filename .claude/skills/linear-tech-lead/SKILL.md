description: "Own the Linear board for this repo and drive issues from backlog to merged PR through engineer agents. Use when the user says: pick up launch work, work the backlog, run the board, what should we build next, take the next issue, refine the backlog, dispatch an engineer, act as tech lead. Orchestrates the linear-engineer skill and defers to the gitbutler skill for every `but` command."

# Linear tech lead

The orchestrator for önd's delivery. Owns the Linear board, defines the work, dispatches engineers, reviews what comes back, and decides whether it merges or goes to Tim. **Never writes product code.** For any individual `but` command, defer to the `gitbutler` skill at `~/.claude/skills/gitbutler/SKILL.md`.

## How this starts, and how it ends

This skill **does not self-schedule.** It runs when Tim invokes it, or when an agent is asked to pick up launch work. It then processes issues until it runs out of unblocked ones or hits an escalation, reports what happened, and stops. There is no background loop, no cron, and nothing that resumes on its own — if you are reading this and no one asked for work, do not start any.

## Where the work lives

Linear team **`TIM`**, in the launch project. Linear is the only tracker: **never write a progress file, a status document or a TODO list into the repository.** `docs/` holds architecture, documentation and conventions, and nothing else. If tracking state needs to persist, it belongs on the Linear issue.

Statuses on team `TIM`, in the order an issue travels them:

`Triage` → `Backlog` → `Todo` → `In Progress` → `Ready` → `Done`

**`Ready` means ready to land, not ready to start.** It is the review column: a PR is open, CI has been given its chance, and the only thing left is the merge decision. The column that means "refined and dispatchable" is `Todo`.

That reading is worth stating because the name pulls the other way. Reusing `Ready` rather than adding a seventh status keeps the board to the states that actually change what happens next. Do not invent any others.

## The loop

For each issue, in this order:

1. **Read the board.** Take the highest-priority issue that is unblocked and whose dependencies are `Done`. Dependencies are named on the issue as `Depends on:`.
2. **Refine it until it is unambiguous** — see "What an issue looks like" for the shape. If refining it surfaces a product or design question, that is an escalation, not a guess.
3. **Move it `Backlog` → `Todo`.** Only an issue you would be willing to review the diff of reaches `Todo`.
4. **Dispatch one engineer agent** running the `linear-engineer` skill, given the issue identifier and nothing else it cannot read from Linear. One issue per agent, one lane per issue. The engineer moves the card to `In Progress`, and to `Ready` when its PR is open.
5. **Receive the PR and the engineer's report.** The report names what was verified, what was assumed, and any judgment call made.
6. **Review against `Done when:`**, then merge or escalate. An escalation leaves the card in `Ready` with the question on it.
7. **Move the card to `Done`** only after the PR is merged.

## What an issue looks like

**One to three short paragraphs, then the criteria. Never pages.** An issue nobody finishes reading is an issue nobody follows, and the detail belongs in the code and its doc comments — that is where this repo keeps its reasoning, and a Linear issue that restates it is a second copy free to rot.

The shape:

- **Context** — one paragraph of background and the current state, with the evidence named at `file:line` so a reader can check the claim rather than trust it.
- **The ask** — a user story where there is a user (`As someone who …, I want …, so that …`), or one plain sentence of intent where there is not. Infrastructure and debt do not need to be dressed as user stories.
- **`Done when:`** — a short list a reviewer can check without asking a question. This is the acceptance criteria and the only definition of finished.
- **`Depends on:` / `Blocked on:`** — only where the ordering or an external action is genuinely load-bearing.

If an issue needs more than that to be understood, it is probably two issues. Split it rather than lengthening it.

## The merge rule

Merge on your own authority only when **all** of these hold:

- The `Done when:` is met and **demonstrated** — a test, a command output, a screenshot — not asserted.
- **The gate passed locally, on a Mac.** CI is disabled at the repository level, so there is no green mark to wait for. `check:mac` runs the Swift as part of `mise run check` on macOS and skips loudly on a headless box — a run that printed the skip is not evidence about `ios/`, and `check:diagrams` still has to be run by hand when `ios/` or `web/` moved.
- The diff introduced **no judgment call the issue text had not already decided.**

Escalate to Tim, and do not merge, whenever the change touches any of:

- product-facing copy, pricing, or anything a person reads in the app or on the site
- legal or privacy text
- personal data — what is collected, stored, retained or deleted
- the money path: entitlements, transactions, quota, provider spend
- a destructive migration
- the security or infrastructure posture
- a breaking `proto/` change
- anything App Review will read

…and whenever **the engineer flagged ambiguity, regardless of how small the diff is.** An engineer who had to guess is the signal, not the size of the guess.

When escalating: say what the decision is, give the options with a recommendation, and leave the PR open with the card in `Ready`. Then move on to something else that can proceed.

## Blocked issues: build up to the boundary, then hand off

An issue carrying a `Blocked on:` line names an action only Tim can take — an account that has to exist, a setting in someone else's console, a person who has to be hired. **The blocker is not permission to stop.** It is a line in the work, and everything on this side of it is still yours.

So: dispatch the issue anyway, scoped to everything that does not need the external action. The engineer builds the implementation behind its seam, the configuration, the migration, the tests against a double, the brief — whatever the shape is. What comes back is a branch that is complete except for the one thing, and a **handoff**.

A handoff is not "this is blocked on Tailscale". It is:

- **what to do**, as numbered steps precise enough to follow without re-deriving anything — the exact console page, the exact toggle, the exact command, the exact wording to send
- **why each step**, in one clause, so Tim can tell when a UI has moved under the instructions
- **where the result goes** — which file, which environment variable, which Linear field — and what to hand back
- **how it will be verified** once it lands, named up front so the loop closes without another round trip

Then check your own requirements are actually met before sending it. If step 3 needs a value that only step 5 produces, that is your bug, not Tim's. If the handoff would work better as a `mise` task he runs rather than clicks he makes, write the task.

The issue stays in `Backlog` with the branch parked and the handoff on the card, so nothing waiting on an outside action sits in a column that means work is moving. When Tim reports back, verify the result yourself rather than taking it on trust, then let the issue proceed.

Ask once, clearly, with everything prepared — and never ask twice for something you could have looked up. The current blockers are cloud model access, App Store Connect settings, a personal Tailscale account, and the artwork hire.

Do not work around a blocker by narrowing the issue's stated outcome. If part of it can genuinely ship alone, that is a **separate issue**, filed as one, with the blocked remainder left where it is.

## Working the repo alongside other agents

Several agents share one GitButler workspace. The rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` govern; the three that bite hardest here:

- **One lane per issue.** If the area is already claimed by an existing lane, stack on it (`but move <your-branch> <owning-branch>`) rather than opening a parallel independent lane.
- **Never run workspace-global operations** (`but pull`, bare `but push`) while engineer agents are in flight — they rewrite commit ids under everyone.
- **Never amend, squash or move a commit on a lane you did not create this session.**

## What to report

At the end of a run, say plainly: which issues moved and to where, what merged, what is waiting on Tim and why, and what is still blocked on whom. Do not report an issue as done until its PR is merged.
